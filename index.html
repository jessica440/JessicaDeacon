          <span style="background-color: black">Hello, I'm Jessica!<br>I founded my own ethical fashion company three years ago, which I run from my family’s farm. CARBS is loud, bright and built to last, offering an alternative to fast fashion. Initially I was learning to code to build my own website for my business, but now I'm looking to build a career in web development.
          <br>
          <br>My interests include:
          <ul style="background-color:  rgb(185, 7, 255)">
          <li>Knitting! And lots of arts & crafts…</li>
          <li>Travelling (mostly Asia, although I still need to visit Sri Lanka and Japan!)</li>
          <li>Rock climbing & cooking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1><span style="background-color: black">Most of my business is done online via my website, which I created using a website builder. I started learning how to code last year because I wanted more control over my website, and I had pushed the website builder to its limits. I wanted to create new functionalities and ideas, so I started to self-learn coding. I then managed to secure some mentoring from previous Founders & Coders, who work at Citizen Ticket, which is how I first became aware of your programme. 
 
          Before that I studied and then worked in fashion, where I developed strong skills in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign and have enjoyed incorporating those skills into this website. 
           
          Although I love designing, the more that I learnt from coding the more I realised I wanted to become a coder. I don’t feel that the fashion industry is the right place for me and I’d like to use my design skills in a different way. My ambition is to continue fashion design as a hobby (I just can’t stop knitting!), while pursuing a career as a full time developer. 
           
          Founding and growing a business can be a lonely and tough road, and I have really missed working as part of a team to solve problems. I’ve really enjoyed the Founders & Coders meetups where I have been able to work with others on solving problems in codewars and learning from free code camp together. 
           
          Self-learning has been challenging but also extremely helpful to begin building my skills, however I know that I benefit even more when I'm learning from people and with others. This is why I believe Founders & Coders is right for me.
